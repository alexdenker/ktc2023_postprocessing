# Submission to the KTC 2023

For this submission, we developed a **postprocessing UNet** for EIT segmentation. The postprocessing network is trained on a dataset of synthetic phantoms and simulated measurements.

## Usage

We provide the `enviroment.yml` file to restore the conda enviroment used for the submission. You can create the environment using the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The network weights are stored [here](https://seafile.zfn.uni-bremen.de/d/faaf3799e6e247198a23/). We precomputed the Jacobian for an empty water tank, as well as some other matrices (smoothness regulariser, node coordinates). This eliminates the need to install FEniCS in the environment. All of these matrices are available [here](https://seafile.zfn.uni-bremen.de/d/9108bc95b2e84cd285f8/) and have to be stored in *data/*. The script `main.py` can be used reconstruct phantoms: 

```
python main.py /path_to_input_folder /path_to_ouput_folder difficulty_level
```


### Enviroment


## Method

Our goal is to train a postprocessing UNet, 

$$ f_\theta(\mathcal{R}(U)) \approx \sigma_\text{segmentation} $$

to predict the segmentation of the conductivity $\sigma$ based on some initial reconstruction $\mathcal{R}(U)$. We directly represent this segmentation map on the $256 \times 256$ pixel grid. Further, the initial reconstruction is also  interpolated to the $256 \times 256$ pixel grid. This has the practical advantage that we can implement the diffusion model as a convolutional neural network and are independent of the underlying mesh. 

### Initial Reconstructions

We use linearised time-difference reconstructions for the conditional input. Computing this linearised time-difference reconstruction amounts to solving a regularised least squares problem

$$ \Delta \sigma = (J_{\sigma_0} \Gamma_e^{-1} J + \alpha_1 R_\text{SM} + \alpha_2 R_\text{Laplace} + \alpha_3 R_\text{NOSER})^{-1} J_{\sigma_0}^T \Gamma_e^{-1} \Delta U, $$

where $J_{\sigma_0}$ is the Jacobian w.r.t. to a constant background conductivity, $\Gamma_e^{-1}$ is the noise precision matrix and $\Delta U = U^\delta - F(\sigma_0)$ is the difference of the measurements. For $F(\sigma_0)$ we make use of the provided measurements of the empty water tank. 

We use a combination of three different priors, where $R_\text{SM}$ denotes a [smoothness prior](https://www.fips.fi/KTC2023_Instructions_v3_Oct12.pdf), $R_\text{Laplace}= - \bigtriangleup$ the graph laplacian and $R_\text{NOSER} = diag(J_{\sigma_0} \Gamma_e^{-1} J)$ the [NOSER](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36909677/) prior. 

In total, we use five different combinations of $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ as each regularisation results in different artifacts in the reconstruction. This means, that our conditional input, interpolated to the pixel grid, is of the size $5 \times 256 \times 256$. 


### Training

### Forward Operator 

### Synthetic Training Data

For the creation of the training dataset, we implemented the complete electrode model and the linearized Jacobian matrix in FEniCS to use our own mesh and speed up the calculations. Here, we use continuous piece wise linear functions for the potential and piece wise constant functions for the reconstruction of the conductivity. 

## Examples

## Evaluation


We evaluate the postprocessing UNet w.r.t. the [score function](https://www.fips.fi/KTC2023_Instructions_v3_Oct12.pdf) used in the challenge.
